# Project Idea  

This project addresses the challenge of training robust machine learning models when domain-specific data is limited. We will first train a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** on a large, non-domain-specific dataset to learn feature representations. Next, we will fine-tune this base model on various small, domain-specific datasets. Our goal is to achieve **comparable performance on domain-specific tasks**, mirroring real-world applications that often have limited data.  

## Datasets  

- **General dataset**: [COCO](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/coco)  
- **Fine-tuned datasets**:  
  - [Food 101](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/food-101)  
  - [Stanford Cars](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/stanford-cars)  

## Models  

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Base model**: Train on a large dataset (COCO).
- **Fine-tuning strategy**:  
  - Freeze the convolutional layers.  
  - Replace and fine-tune the fully connected (FNN) part on the smaller datasets.  
- **Model format**: Still to be determined.  

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  
- **Current status**: No concrete plan yet. Need to explore approaches.
